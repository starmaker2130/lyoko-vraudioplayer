# XRAudioPlayer

an XR audio player for web experiences and distributed applications

The XRAudioPLayer is a subset of the larger experimental XRMediaPlayer. That project is going to be under heavy development as of the end of this week given the start of the winter ter (expected release: February 2, 2019).

This module generates an audio player that users can experience in VR, AR, or traditinoal flat modes. Experiences are generated using Three.js and AFrame to achieve a secure, cross-platform standard for immersive web experiences. From a user's perspective the content can be viewed using a wide range of devices and formats. From the developer's perspective it can be implemented in a few lines of JavaScript code in both modular server-side and non-modular client-side applications.

Usage:
*server-side
*client-side
