# XRAudioPlayer

an XR audio player for web experiences and distributed applications

The **_XRAudioPlayer_** is a subset of the experimental **_XRMediaPlayer_** object. The latter is going to be under heavy development as of the end of this week given the start of the winter term (expected release: February 2, 2019).

**_XRAudioPlayer_** as the name suggests generates an audio player that users can experience in VR, AR, or traditinoal flat modes. Experiences are generated using Three.js and AFrame to achieve a secure, cross-platform standard for immersive web experiences.

Users can view content using a wide range of devices and formats. Developers can be implement the module in a few lines of JavaScript code in both modular server-side and non-modular client-side applications.
